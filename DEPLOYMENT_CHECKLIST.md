# ‚úÖ Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure successful deployment of your Oil Spill Detection System.

## üéØ Pre-Deployment Setup

### GitHub Repository
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Repository is public (or has proper access for GitHub Actions)
- [ ] All environment files are properly configured

### Hugging Face Setup
- [ ] Create Hugging Face account
- [ ] Create model repository: `sahilvishwa2108/oil-spill-detection-models`
- [ ] Upload your model files:
  - [ ] `deeplab_final_model.h5`
  - [ ] `unet_final_model.h5`
- [ ] Set repository to public

### Azure Setup (GitHub Student Pack)
- [ ] Activate Azure for Students
- [ ] Create Resource Group
- [ ] Create App Service (Python 3.10)
- [ ] Note down App Service name

### Vercel Setup
- [ ] Create Vercel account
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Azure
- [ ] Create Azure App Service
- [ ] Configure deployment from GitHub
- [ ] Set environment variables:
  ```
  ENVIRONMENT=production
  HUGGINGFACE_REPO=sahilvishwa2108/oil-spill-detection-models
  CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
  WEBSITE_PORT=8000
  ```
- [ ] Test backend: `https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/health`

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel
- [ ] Import project to Vercel
- [ ] Set root directory to `frontend`
- [ ] Configure environment variables:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.azurewebsites.net
  NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production
  ```
- [ ] Deploy and test

### Step 3: Update CORS Settings
- [ ] Update Azure environment variable with actual Vercel URL
- [ ] Restart Azure App Service
- [ ] Test end-to-end functionality

### Step 4: Set up GitHub Actions (Optional)
- [ ] Add Azure credentials to GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Add Vercel credentials to GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Test automated deployment

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Health endpoint: `/health`
- [ ] API documentation: `/docs`
- [ ] Model loading in logs
- [ ] CORS working with frontend

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Application loads successfully
- [ ] Image upload works
- [ ] API calls successful
- [ ] Model predictions display correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works

### End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Upload test image
- [ ] Select different models
- [ ] Verify prediction results
- [ ] Check processing times

## üìã Final URLs

After successful deployment, update these URLs:

### For Your Resume:
```
üåê Live Demo: https://your-project.vercel.app
üîß Backend API: https://your-backend.azurewebsites.net
üìö Source Code: https://github.com/yourusername/oil_spill_detection
```

### For Documentation:
- [ ] Update README.md with live URLs
- [ ] Update any references to localhost
- [ ] Add deployment status badges

## üéâ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Backend responds to health checks
- [ ] Models load successfully
- [ ] Image upload and prediction works
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Application is responsive on mobile

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Models not loading**: Check Hugging Face repository permissions
2. **CORS errors**: Update environment variables and restart services
3. **Slow startup**: Normal on first load when downloading models
4. **Memory errors**: Azure free tier has limited memory

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check backend logs
az webapp log download --name your-app-name --resource-group your-rg

# Test API directly
curl https://your-backend.azurewebsites.net/health

# Check Vercel logs
vercel logs your-project-url
```

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start with backend deployment** - easier to debug
2. **Test each component** individually before integration
3. **Monitor Azure logs** during first deployment
4. **Use smaller model files** if memory is an issue
5. **Keep environment variables** secure and documented

## üéØ Next Steps After Deployment

- [ ] Add monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Set up custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Implement user authentication (optional)
- [ ] Add more model options
- [ ] Create API rate limiting
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging

**Estimated Total Deployment Time: 2-3 hours**

Good luck with your deployment! üöÄ
